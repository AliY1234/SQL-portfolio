# Ali Ay's SQL & Power BI(Dashboard) - portfolio
Personal projects using SQL and Power BI


Hello, and thanks for stopping by! This repository contains examples of SQL I've written for solo projects. You'll also get a chance to explore a Power BI dashboard which showcases my data visualization skills. Feel free to take a look around and reach out if you have any feedback or questions.

# Cycling Club Data Analysis

This [SQL](Cycling%20Club%20Data%20Analysis.sql) project showcases my proficiency in working with a dataset related to a cycling club. The dataset includes information about club members, their bikes, track times, track locations, and more. Each table represents a specific aspect of the cycling club's operations. I've created and manipulated tables, performed data insertion and updates, and executed various SQL queries. These queries help extract meaningful insights, such as tracking member activities, analyzing track data, and identifying member characteristics. Overall, this portfolio demonstrates my data analysis skills using SQL for a cycling club dataset.

# Spotify Top 50 tracks Analysis

In this [SQL](Top%2050%20spotify%20tracks%202020.sql) project, I performed an analysis using the Kaggle dataset "Top 50 Spotify Tracks 2020" by Atilla Colak. I utilized SQL queries to gain insights into the characteristics of these top songs, including energy, danceability, key, and more. The analysis aimed to uncover trends and patterns in the most popular songs of 2020, providing valuable information for music enthusiasts and data analysts.

# AdventureWorks Power BI Dashboard

**[Download my AdventureWorks Dashboard](AdventureWorks%20Power%20BI%20Dashboard%20.pdf)**

I have successfully created a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for AdventureWorks Cycles, a fictional manufacturing company specializing in bicycles and accessories. This dashboard is designed to provide a detailed view of the company's operations and help in tracking key performance indicators (KPIs), analyzing regional performance, product-level trends, and identifying high-value customers. 

Comprising four distinct pages â€” Executive dash, Map, Product detail and Customer detail Here's a breakdown of what I have accomplished in each stage.

**Stage 1: Data Transformation**
I've automated the extraction, transformation, and loading of project data using Power Query. This involved connecting to data sources, shaping data with various tools, and applying transformations, including rolling calendars, conditional columns, and aggregations. I also established data source parameters and integrated Excel models for streamlined data preparation.

**Stage 2: Data Modeling**
I've adhered to data modeling best practices by creating an efficient AdventureWorks data model. This model emphasizes concepts like database normalization, fact-dimension tables, primary-foreign keys, and relationship cardinality, ensuring an optimal foundation for analysis.

**Stage 3: DAX Analysis**
I've enhanced data analysis capabilities with Data Analysis Expressions (DAX). This involved crafting calculated columns and measures, utilizing DAX functions for mathematical, statistical, and time intelligence tasks, all while considering row and filter context.

**Stage 4: Dynamic Reporting**
I've brought data to life with interactive reports and dashboards that adhere to data visualization best practices. These include cards, KPIs, line charts, tables, matrices, and map visuals. Interactivity features like drill-through, slicers, bookmarks, and formatting enhancements have been added for a user-friendly, informative output.

Overall, this Power BI dashboard is now a powerful tool for AdventureWorks Cycles, enabling data-driven decisions and offering valuable insights into their business operations. The attached pdf will provide a visual representation of the Dashboard.

# Maven Markets Power BI Dashboard

**[Download my Maven Markets Dashboard](Maven%20Markets%20Dashboard%20.pdf)**

Im pleased to announce the successful creation of a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for Maven Markets, a fictional supermarket franchise. The dashboard is structured across two main pages, each focusing on crucial aspects of the business.

**Page 1: Topline Performance**
This page is designed to provide an overview of the company's overall performance, featuring four key performance indicators (KPIs)
The Product Matrix includes vital information such as product-wise transactions, profit margins, and return rates. Additionally, a dynamic map visualizes regional and city-wise sales, allowing for a quick assessment of geographic performance.

**Page 2: Customer Detail**
The second page delves into customer-centric insights, offering a detailed view of the top customer's orders and revenue. Key elements of this page include:
The Top Customer Overview provides detailed information about the highest-value customer, including their orders and contribution to overall revenue. The Top 10 Customers Matrix offers a snapshot of the most valuable clients, and the Bar Chart provides an insightful comparison of different stores' performance and profits.

**Development Stages:**

**Stage 1: Data Transformation**
I've streamlined the data preparation process by automating data extraction, transformation, and loading using Power Query. This involves connecting to relevant data sources, applying necessary transformations, and ensuring data integrity. I've also implemented rolling calendars, conditional columns, and aggregations, optimizing the data for further analysis.

**Stage 2: Data Modeling**
I've adhered to best practices in data modelling, emphasizing database normalization, fact-dimension tables, primary-foreign keys, and relationship cardinality. This ensures a robust foundation for analysis, enabling efficient queries and reporting.

**Stage 3: DAX Analysis**
The data analysis capabilities have been enhanced using Data Analysis Expressions (DAX). I've crafted calculated columns and measures, employing DAX functions for mathematical, statistical, and time intelligence tasks. This ensures accurate and meaningful insights, considering row and filter context.

**Stage 4: Dynamic Reporting**
I've created visually compelling and interactive reports adhering to the best data visualization practices. The dashboard includes cards, KPIs, line charts, tables, matrices, and map visuals. Interactivity features such as drill-through, slicers, and formatting enhancements have been incorporated for a user-friendly and informative output.

The attached PDF provides a visual representation of the Power BI dashboard, showcasing its functionality and the valuable insights it offers to Maven Markets for data-driven decision-making.
