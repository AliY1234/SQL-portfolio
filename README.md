# Ali Ay's SQL & Power BI(Dashboard) - portfolio
Personal projects using SQL and Power BI


Hello, and thanks for stopping by! This repository contains examples of SQL I've written for solo projects. You'll also get a chance to explore a Power BI dashboard which showcases my data visualization skills. Feel free to take a look around and reach out if you have any feedback or questions.

# Cycling Club Data Analysis

This [SQL](Cycling%20Club%20Data%20Analysis.sql) project showcases my proficiency in working with a dataset related to a cycling club. The dataset includes information about club members, their bikes, track times, track locations, and more. Each table represents a specific aspect of the cycling club's operations. I've created and manipulated tables, performed data insertion and updates, and executed various SQL queries. These queries help extract meaningful insights, such as tracking member activities, analyzing track data, and identifying member characteristics. Overall, this portfolio demonstrates my data analysis skills using SQL for a cycling club dataset.

# Spotify Top 50 tracks Analysis

In this [SQL](Top%2050%20spotify%20tracks%202020.sql) project, I performed an analysis using the Kaggle dataset "Top 50 Spotify Tracks 2020" by Atilla Colak. I utilized SQL queries to gain insights into the characteristics of these top songs, including energy, danceability, key, and more. The analysis aimed to uncover trends and patterns in the most popular songs of 2020, providing valuable information for music enthusiasts and data analysts.

# AdventureWorks Power BI Dashboard

**[Download my AdventureWorks Dashboard](AdventureWorks%20Power%20BI%20Dashboard%20.pdf)**

I have successfully created a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for AdventureWorks Cycles, a fictional manufacturing company specializing in bicycles and accessories. This dashboard is designed to provide a detailed view of the company's operations and help in tracking key performance indicators (KPIs), analyzing regional performance, product-level trends, and identifying high-value customers. 

Comprising four distinct pages â€” Executive dash, Map, Product detail and Customer detail Here's a breakdown of what I have accomplished in each stage.

**Stage 1: Data Transformation**
I've automated the extraction, transformation, and loading of project data using Power Query. This involved connecting to data sources, shaping data with various tools, and applying transformations, including rolling calendars, conditional columns, and aggregations. I also established data source parameters and integrated Excel models for streamlined data preparation.

**Stage 2: Data Modeling**
I've adhered to data modeling best practices by creating an efficient AdventureWorks data model. This model emphasizes concepts like database normalization, fact-dimension tables, primary-foreign keys, and relationship cardinality, ensuring an optimal foundation for analysis.

**Stage 3: DAX Analysis**
I've enhanced data analysis capabilities with Data Analysis Expressions (DAX). This involved crafting calculated columns and measures, utilizing DAX functions for mathematical, statistical, and time intelligence tasks, all while considering row and filter context.

**Stage 4: Dynamic Reporting**
I've brought data to life with interactive reports and dashboards that adhere to data visualization best practices. These include cards, KPIs, line charts, tables, matrices, and map visuals. Interactivity features like drill-through, slicers, bookmarks, and formatting enhancements have been added for a user-friendly, informative output.

Overall, this Power BI dashboard is now a powerful tool for AdventureWorks Cycles, enabling data-driven decisions and offering valuable insights into their business operations. The attached pdf will provide a visual representation of the Dashboard.
