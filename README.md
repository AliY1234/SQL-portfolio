Coursework and personal projects using SQL


Hello, and thanks for stopping by! This repository contains examples of SQL I've written for solo projects and while working through SQL. Feel free to take a look around and reach out if you have any feedback or questions.

# Cycling Club Data Analysis

This [SQL](Cycling%20Club%20Data%20Analysis.sql) project showcases my proficiency in working with a dataset related to a cycling club. The dataset includes information about club members, their bikes, track times, track locations, and more. Each table represents a specific aspect of the cycling club's operations. I've created and manipulated tables, performed data insertion and updates, and executed various SQL queries. These queries help extract meaningful insights, such as tracking member activities, analyzing track data, and identifying member characteristics. Overall, this portfolio demonstrates my data analysis skills using SQL for a cycling club dataset.

# Spotify Top 50 tracks Analysis

In this [SQL](Top%2050%20spotify%20tracks%202020.sql) project, I performed an analysis using the Kaggle dataset "Top 50 Spotify Tracks 2020" by Atilla Colak. I utilized SQL queries to gain insights into the characteristics of these top songs, including energy, danceability, key, and more. The analysis aimed to uncover trends and patterns in the most popular songs of 2020, providing valuable information for music enthusiasts and data analysts.
