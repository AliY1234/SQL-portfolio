# Cycling Club Data Analysis

This [SQL](Cycling%20Club%20Data%20Analysis.sql) portfolio showcases my proficiency in working with a dataset related to a cycling club. The dataset includes information about club members, their bikes, track times, track locations, and more. Each table represents a specific aspect of the cycling club's operations. I've created and manipulated tables, performed data insertion and updates, and executed various SQL queries. These queries help extract meaningful insights, such as tracking member activities, analyzing track data, and identifying member characteristics. Overall, this portfolio demonstrates my data analysis skills using SQL for a cycling club dataset.
